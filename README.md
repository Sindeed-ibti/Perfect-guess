# Perfect-guess

This is my first project as I've started to learn Python

# Game Details: 

This is a simple Python-based console game where the player tries to guess a secret number generated by the computer. It's a fun and interactive way to practice logic and improve guessing strategies.

# Game Rules :
1. The number to guess is randomly generated between 50 and 100.

2. The player must input whole numbers only.

3. The game gives hints after every incorrect guess to guide the player.

4. The game ends only when the player guesses the correct number.

5. The fewer the number of guesses, the more "perfect" your guessing skills!
